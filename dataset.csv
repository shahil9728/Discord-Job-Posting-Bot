"It's a very big cycle, apparently the US federal printed so much money like a kid and now VCs were throwing money at shit companies and startups like anything, so that they could make a bigger exit in the next round. As there was a lot of free money in the economy, i.e each person had extra 1000$ let's say, they wanted to buy more things, but the supply was limited, as u can't increase it this quickly, the value of the goods rose, and the purchasing power value of a dollar decreased.  Each dollar has gotten more costlier, gave rise to inflation and now we're moving into recession, companies don't have the free money now and are struggling to survive as it's becoming difficult for them to raise their next round, as VCs now are willing to put money only in meaningful startups/companies. Well how will the companies increase their runway to survive? One way is to cut off costs and decrease the burn rate, which they apparently are doing by laying people off. The pandemic, and the russian-ukrainian war also contributed to this.",no,
